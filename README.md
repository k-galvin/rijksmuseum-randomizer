This Rijksmuseum Randomizer web-app gives the user a random piece of artwork of their chosen type from the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, Netherlands. When a category is chosen or the page is refreshed a new piece of art is provided. For each piece of art the title and artist name are displayed. 

The API used in this web-app is the [Rijksmuseum RijksData API](https://data.rijksmuseum.nl/object-metadata/api/). It is a JSON based service that allows developers to use the Rijksmuseum's freely accessible content.

This Web-App was previously deployed using Replit [here](https://rijksmuseum-randomizer.kategalvin.repl.co/), but no longer is due to their pricing changes.
